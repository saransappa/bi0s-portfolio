    The club’s story starts when its founder, Mr. Vipin Pavithran, who worked in the US,
    for over 10 years experienced in software engineering joined Amrita University in 2006.

    He quickly realised that the students here had little focus, confidence and exposure to
    take on the real world, due to the absence of proper mentoring and support.

    He is still supporting us and taking out team to a top position day by day. He always motivates us if we failed to perform well in any CTF.

    We are very grateful for having this kind of mentor.

  Quote: “One of the vivid memories that I have of my bachelors was lack of support from the institution. I
    know the value of right guidance at the right time and how it can make a huge impact. This made me want to help any one who needed guidance.”

    In 2007, a team of enthusiasts in Cybersecurity formed a club under the mentorship of Vipin P.  Initially, the students were not really confident of getting into 
    this field. However, they were highly motivated and enthusiastic about it. While at the same time, Vipin was however, very confident in his students, and having prior 
    experience in software development was certain that his students would come on top. 

    When we started playing CTFs there were a lot setbacks due to lack of resources. But we went playing differnet CTFs then we were selected for PHD CTF finals 2012 
    since we were the only Indian team to play PHD CTF quals 2012. However, we were not able to perform well in the PHD CTF finals 2012. From then, we started playing 
    more and more CTFs to gain experience and ofcourse knowledge.
  Quote: “This was a great confidence booster for not only them but also inspired other students who now
    thought they too can, if they try. Prior to this most Amrita students believed that to win in a
    national contest they needed to be from IITs.”

    We are the No. 1 CTF team in the country for 4 years running! 
    We are consistently competing and beating with India's premier institutions such as IITs, NITs and IIITs in CTFs. We have been climbing up the international CTF ranking
    every year and we are currently one of the top 20 teams of the world.
